IF NO LOAD IS PRESENT?

















HOW MANY QUERIES DOES SNOWFLAKE QUEUES 


BEFORE IT SPINS UP ADDITIONAL CLUSTER?











temos 2 scaling policies,

"standard"


e 


"economy"....











standard --> NO MOMENTO EM QUE 1 QUERY ENTRA 

NA QUEUE, QUANDO EXISTIR 1 QUERY,


O SNOWFLAKE JÁ VAI SPIN UP 


CÓPIAS DE SEUS CLUSTERS,

PARA 

ACABAR COM ESSA FILA...















STANDARD:  



""IMMEDIATELY WHEN EITHER A QUERY IS QUERIED,

OR THE SYSTEM DETECTS THAT THERE'S ONE MORE QUERY 
THAN THE CURRENTLY-RUNNING CLUSTERS CAN EXECUTE""...















ECONOMY:


ONLY IF THE SYSTEM ESTIMATES THERE'S ENOUGH 
QUERY LOAD TO KEEP THE CLUSTER 
BUSY FOR ____aT LEAST___ 6 MINUTES...




















WHAT IS THE TRIGGER TO SUSPEND A CLUSTER IF NO LOAD IS PRESENT:










standard:

        AFTER 2 TO 3 CONSECUTIVE 
        SUCCESSFUL checks (performed at 1-minute intervals),
        WHICH DETERMINE WHETHER THE LOAD ON THE LEAST-LOADED 
        CLUSTER COULD BE REDISTRIBUTED TO THE OTHER 
        CLUSTERS WITHOUT SPINNING UP 
        THE CLUSTER AGAIN..






ECONOMY:

        After 5 to 6 consecutive SUCCESSFUL checks 
        (1 minute intervals),
        WHICH DETERMINE THE LOAD ON THE LEAST-LOADED 
        CLUSTER COULD BE REDISTRIBUTED 

        TO OTHER CLUSTERS WITHOUT SPINNING UP THE 
        CLUSTER AGAIN....
