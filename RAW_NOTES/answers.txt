Why are you rebuilding the table every time?


1) Due to the size of the two other tables (SHA_TO_UPS and RAW_TOPICS), I thought it 
would be cheaper to recreate the final table (PREMADE_4EYES) than to copy data into 
it progressively (because then we would probably need to run comparisons between the tables, 
to check which rows should be copied from the two initial tables to the final table, with joins). I also
thought about using streams, but I couldn't find a way to make the use-case work without getting 
increased costs.


How frequently are you rebuilding the table?


2) The final table is being rebuilt daily, but the other two tables are never rebuilt,
they only receive new data once files are uploaded to their S3 stages (pipes).


How much new data is being added?


3) To the RAW_TOPICS table, one of the two tables used to recreate the final table,
each day 200GB or 400GB are added/copied. There also were days in which no data was added/copied to
that table. The time to recreate the final table grows, in average, 11 minutes each day. 
(Now at 3h 36m)


Do the upstream tables have an append-only, merge, or insert + delete pattern?


4) The upstream tables have a append-only pattern (only new data gets added to the
RAW_TOPICS table, and no other changes are made).


Once data is added to the upstream tables, how quickly does that change need to be reflected in the downstream table?


5) RAW_TOPICS receives new data at 6PM CST, and the Final Table (PREMADE_4EYES) gets recreated at 2AM CST, by a task. The change 
needs to be reflected in the same day the Table gets recreated.
