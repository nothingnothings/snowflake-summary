NESSA AULA,

TEREMOS 1 HIGH-LEVEL OVERVIEW 


DA SNOWFLAKE DATABASE E SUA OBJECT HIERARCHY E ROLE HIERARCHY...












O PROFESSOR TEM ESTE ESQUEMA:







                      ORGANIZATION 
                        

                  ACCOUNT-LEVEL OBJECTS



USER ROLE  DATABASE    WAREHOUSE     OTHER ACCOUNT OBJECTS
                        

                  SCHEMA-LEVEL OBJECTS


TABLE VIEW  STAGE   STORED PROCEDURE    UDF   OTHER SCHEMA OBJECTS 
























--> user, role, database, warehouse e other account objects,


TODOS ESSES SAO "ACCOUNT-LEVEL OBJECTS"...












--> TEMOS TAMBÉM OS "SCHEMA-LEVEL OBJECTS",


como tables, views, stages, stored procedures, UDFs e 


OUTROS SCHEMA OBJECTS,


COMO 

STREAMS E ETC...

















--> ESSA OBJECT HIERARCHY É CONSTANTE,

E NUNCA MUDA...










--> QUANTO À ROLE HIERARCHY,


TEMOS 


ESTAS REGRAS PRÉ-DEFINIDAS PELO SNOWFLAKE:













                    ACCOUNT ADMIN 

            SECURITYADMIN         SYSADMIN 

            
                USERADMIN















SABER A DISTINCAO ENTRE ELES É MT IMPORTANTE....










--> SE QUISERMOS CONSTRUIR HIERARCHIES,


precisamos saber a diferenca entre eles...








--> DEVEMOS TER 1 HIGH-LEVEL OVERVIEW 


SOBRE ESSES ROLES...
















DE ACORDO COM OS Docs, temos:















ACCOUNTADMIN: (aka ACCOUNT ADMINISTRATOR)...





--> ROLE THAT ENCAPSULATES THE SYSADMIN AND SECURITYADMIN 
SYSTEM-DEFINED ROLES. IT IS THE TOP-LEVEL ROLE IN THE SYSTEM,
AND SHOULD BE GRANTED TO ONLY A LIMITED/CONTROLLED 
NUMBER OF USERS IN YOUR ACCOUNT.












SECURITYADMIN (security administrator)




--> ROLE THAT CAN MANAGE ANY OBJECT GRANT GLOBALLY,

AS WELL AS CREATE, MONITOR AND MANAGE USERS AND ROLES.


--> MORE SPECIFICALLY, THIS ROLE:




1) IS GRANTED THE "MANAGE GRANTS" security privilege,
to be able to modify ANY GRANT, also REVOKE any grant.




2) Inherits the privileges of the USERADMIN role,

via the system role hierarchy (USERADMIN role is granted 

to SECURITYADMIN)














USERADMIN (aka USER AND ROLE ADMINISTRATOR)





--> role that is dedicated to USER and ROLE management only. More 
specifically, this role:



1) IS GRANTED THE "CREATE USER" and "CREATE ROLE" security privileges



2) Can create users and roles in the account.






--> this role can ALSO manage users and roles that it owns. Only the 
role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on an object (ex: user or role),

or a higher role, can modify the object's properties...















SYSADMIN (aka System Administrator)





--> Role that has privileges to CREATE WAREHOUSES and DATABASES (and other objects)

IN AN ACCOUNT.



if, AS RECOMMENDED, you create a role hierarchy that ultimately 
assigns all custom roles to the SYSADMIN ROLE,


this role also has the ability to grant privileges on warehouses,
databases and other objects to other roles.

















--> PODE CRIAR USERS E ROLES NA ACCOUNT...
